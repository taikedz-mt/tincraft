# Tincraft

Tin, from moreores, is pretty useless in most games.

Here's some crafts to make tin marginally useful.

## Tin Tools

All tools are pretty effective - but they just drop items on the floor.

* Cheap Dagger - same recipe as a sword
* Brittle Chisel - same recipe as a pick
* Weak Hatchet - same recipe as an axe
* Toy Spade - same recipe as a shovel

They do OK damage to mobs, but don't expect them to last long. They're also useless against players.

## Tin Recipes

If you are stuck for steel, you can always:

1. Make strong tin using 3 tin ingots
2. Make a stone and metal mix using tin and stone
3. Cook the stone and metal mix to obtain an iron lump

Yes, it's more alchemy than craft, and you need a lot of tin, but if the area has been stripped of iron, this is your second best bet...
